system_property.plugin.restapi.muc.case-insensitive-lookup.enabled=Names of MUC rooms should be node-prepped. This, however, was not guaranteed the case in some versions of Openfire and this plugin. Earlier versions of this plugin used a case-insensitive lookup to work around this. As this should be unneeded, and is quite resource intensive, this behavior has been made configurable (disabled by default).
system_property.plugin.restapi.muc.room-mutex.enabled=Controls if a mutual exclusion lock is used when an API interacts with a room.
